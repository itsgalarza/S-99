## S-99: Ninety-nine Scala problems
______
These are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland.

The goal is to find the most elegant solution of the given problems. Efficiency is important, but clarity is even more crucial. Some of the (easy) problems can be trivially solved using built-in functions. However, in these cases, you learn more if you try to find your own solution.

All the information and the problems can be found [here](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

**Happy coding**
